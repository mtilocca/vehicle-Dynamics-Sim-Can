  # Physical dimensions and mass
  geometry:
    mass_kg: 220000.0                  # 220 tons empty weight (larger than Komatsu 980E)
    wheelbase_m: 6.35                  # Extra-long wheelbase for stability under extreme loads
    track_width_m: 7.20                # Very wide for desert haul roads
    wheel_radius_m: 1.95               # ~3.9m diameter tires (37.00R57 typical)

  # Electric drivetrain configuration (dual rear AC motors)
  drivetrain:
    motor_torque_max_nm: 145000.0      # Combined torque from dual rear motors
    motor_power_max_w: 3200000.0       # 3.2 MW (4,290 hp) total power (higher for desert heat)
    gear_ratio: 28.0                   # Large reduction for loaded climbing
    efficiency: 0.93                   # Slightly lower due to dual-motor coordination

  # Braking system (dynamic + mechanical)
  brakes:
    brake_torque_max_nm: 180000.0      # Massive braking for loaded descents
    regen_efficiency_active: 0.68      # Good regen in WA heat (thermal limited)
    regen_efficiency_coast: 0.03       # Minimal coasting regen (hot ambient reduces effectiveness)

  # Battery pack specifications (thermal-optimized for 45-50°C ambient)
  battery:
    capacity_kwh: 1650.0               # 1.65 MWh pack (larger for longer hauls in Pilbara)
    nominal_voltage_v: 1200.0          # Higher voltage system (1200V) for efficiency
    max_charge_power_kw: 600.0         # 600 kW fast charging (limited by desert heat)
    max_discharge_power_kw: 2400.0     # 2.4 MW peak discharge (thermal derating considered)
    efficiency_charge: 0.91            # Lower due to extreme cooling requirements
    efficiency_discharge: 0.93         # Lower due to thermal management overhead
    min_soc: 0.18                      # Conservative for battery longevity in heat
    max_soc: 0.88                      # Conservative max to prevent thermal issues

  # Resistive forces (desert conditions)
  resistance:
    drag_coefficient: 1.95             # Worse aero than Komatsu (Chinese design philosophy)
    rolling_resistance: 9500.0         # Higher due to red iron ore dust, soft top layer (9.5 kN)

  # Operational limits (Western Australian mining environment)
  limits:
    v_max_mps: 18.5                    # 66.6 km/h (slightly lower for safety on dusty roads)
    v_stop_eps: 0.6                    # Coarser stop detection for ultra-heavy vehicle

# XCMG-Specific Notes:
# - Dual rear AC motors with differential coordination (not modeled yet, treated as single unit)
# - Rigid frame rear-drive (all propulsion through rear axle)
# - Front axle: passive load-bearing only, no drive
